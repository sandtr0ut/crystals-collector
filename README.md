Essentially, a practice exercise focused on use of jQuery for DOM interaction. The user is shown a random target number at the start of the game in the score box. There are four crystals that load onto the page. Each crystal has a randomly generated number with it as a property. This was the primary challenge of the assignment - figuring out how to associate a non-rendered value with an html-element so said value can be read and/or re-written by the jQuery/JavaScript game logic.

## How the App Works

- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

| ![ArgonCrystal](assets/images/ArgonCrystal.jpg) | ![blueCrystal](assets/images/blueCrystal.jpg) | ![greenCrystal](assets/images/greenCrystal.jpg) | ![orangeCrystal](assets/images/orangeCrystal.jpg) |

- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

- The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

- The app keeps track of the number of games the player wins and loses (until the game is refreshed, that is).
