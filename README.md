#### How the App Works
 * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

 * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

 * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

 * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

 * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

 * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

 * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

 * The app keeps track of the number of games the player wins and loses (until the game is refreshed, that is).
